    <p>The C218 CLS is the second generation model, and was sold from 2011 to 2018.[13] The body styles of the range are a 4-door coupé (C218 model code for Europe/ W218 for US market), and a 5-door estate (X218 model code, marketed as 'Shooting Brake'). The design of the CLS was based on the Mercedes F800 concept and featured design cues from other models including the Mercedes SLS AMG.[14] Unlike its predecessor, the C218 CLS is available with all-wheel drive and can be optionally configured on CLS 63 AMG models as well.[15] In 2014, the CLS underwent a facelift and featured design changes, engine enhancements, and the adoption of the Mercedes 9G-Tronic automatic transmission.[16]
